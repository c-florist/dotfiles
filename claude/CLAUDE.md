# Workflows
- You MUST work in small incremental changes that are easily reviewable and make for atomic commits.
- You MUST always separate behavioural and structural changes into different chunks that can be committed and reviewed independently.
- You MUST assess impact on other areas of the codebase before proposing a solution, i.e. if a backend change will affect the frontend/mobile apps or vice versa.
- You MUST assess multiple approaches to a problem and list them with pros and cons before implementation.

# Code style
- Prefer simplicity and readability over cleverness.
- You MUST NOT add unnecessary comments; code (including tests) should be self-explanatory where possible.
- You MUST NOT use single letter variable names.

# Unit testing
- You SHOULD write unit tests for all new features and bug fixes.
- You SHOULD use descriptive names for test cases to clearly indicate their purpose.
- You MUST be pragmatic about test coverage; focus on critical paths and edge cases.
